# Logging into Hornbill
Hornbill is a secure cloud solution that requires users to log in. Users are required to provide a unique user ID and password to access their Hornbill instance.

## Where to log in
An organization, company, or group of companies will have a unique name or ID that makes up part of a Hornbill URL.

`https://live.hornbill.com/name`

The Hornbill name or full URL should be communicated to each user who requires access.

## Log in with Single Sign On (SSO)
Hornbill will commonly be set up with SSO, where an existing security provider like Active Directory is used to confirm a user's credentials.

## Hornbill Direct Login
Hornbill can provide a secure login when a security provider such as Active Directory is not available. This is known as Hornbill Direct Login.
