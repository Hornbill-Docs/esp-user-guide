The Employee Portal provides access to the Employees of your organization. All users that have been added to Hornbill will have access to the Employee Portal.

The Employee Portal is a highly configurable environment where you can add widgets and enable features for your employees to be able to access their services, communicate with the Service Desk, submit and view requests, chat with support staff, and access shared documents.

The Employee Portal can be accessed through the main Hornbill browser app by both Basic Users and Application Users. Users can also access the Employee Portal using the Hornbill Mobile Catalog app.
