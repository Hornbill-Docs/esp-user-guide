# My Company
Your organization's employees can go to the Employee Portal --- also known as Company Home --- to access their services, communicate with the Service Desk, submit and view requests, chat with support staff, and access shared documents. All users who have been added to Hornbill can access the portal.

The Employee Portal is highly configurable. You can add widgets and enable features for your organization's users.

Basic and full users can access the portal through [the main Hornbill browser app](/esp-user-guide/company-home#web-browser), as well as by using [the Hornbill mobile catalog app](/esp-user-guide/company-home#mobile-version).

## Web browser
### Accessing
You can access Hornbill using any web browser. Navigate to live.hornbill.com/<Your_Instance>. If you don't know your instance name, you may need to contact your IT support team. Users that are not subscribed to any Hornbill Apps (Basic Users) will be taken directly to the Employee Portal when they log in. Users that are subscribed to one or more applications will access the Employee Portal through the Company Home option under the Home Icon in the left-hand menu bar.

::: tip
If you are a full user, you can set the Company Home as your default starting point (i.e. your landing page). While on the Company Home page, click your profile photo, then click **Make this my default view**. With a default view like this selected, now when you click on the Hornbill logo in the top banner, you are also returned here.

### Navigation
**Header.** To navigate between pages, the top section of the page contains links to other business areas that have been defined. Each of these areas can have its own page or may link to a dedicated service. Within the header, there is also a breadcrumb that gives you a link back to previous pages and to the Company Home page.

**Body.** The main body of each page consists of one or more widgets that have been added and configured by a page manager. These widgets provide information, links, and the ability to interact with one or more service desks.

**Footer.** At the bottom of the page, an optional section may be displayed that provides details about your company, including contact information and social media links.


## Mobile version
Hornbill has provided a progressive web app (PWA) to give users a fast and UI-rich solution to accessing their company's home page, which can be packed full of valuable information and Service Catalog access.

### Accessing
Users can access the mobile app using a mobile phone's browser. Navigate to `mcatalog.hornbill.com/<Your_Instance>/`. If you don't know your instance name, contact your IT support team. A login button displays when you first connect. In most cases, this will be your network login for your company.

### Home screen
Once you are logged in, you can add the Employee Portal to your mobile device's home screen. If you are using an Android device, you may get a prompt (*Add the Hornbill App to your Home Screen*). If you do this, an application icon will be added to your phone that provides quick access back to Hornbill and also opens the app in a full screen. On an iOS device, you can select from the Safari Options when on the Employee Portal page to add the site to your home screen.

### Navigation
In the top right of the mobile app, use the menu button to view and navigate to other available pages and options.

**Domain pages.** A list of the available pages that you can navigate to are listed here. These pages normally represent the main business areas within your company. A link back to the main page is provided in the header.
