# Co-Workers
The Co-workers acts as a staff directory for all the users in Hornbill. From this list you can search for co-workers to get contact information such as an email address or phone number. From here you can also start a conversation, award someone, or start a skype chat. See which co-workers are active or available by seeing their Presence and Availability displayed in the list.

This list contains a maximum of 30 co-workers with an option to navigate through the additional pages at the bottom of the list if the number of co-workers exceeds 30.

## Filter

The filter allows you to quickly locate a co-worker in the list. As you type the list will automatically display only the co-workers that include the first name, last name, users full name, site or organizational group that you are typing.

## Type
Filter the list of users by:

Co-worker - A user who has a access to collaboration on Hornbill via a collaboration subscription
Basic User - A user who only has access to self service via the service portal
All - Both Co-workers and Basic users
Sorting
Two options are provided for sorting.

The co-worker list can be sorted by Username, First name, Last name, Job title, Location, Site name or Manager
A second option allow you to display the list in either ascending or descending order.
