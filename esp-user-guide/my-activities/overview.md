# My Activities
Activities are your to-do list. Activities can be created manually from your activities views and from entity views in installed line-of-business applications; they can also be created automatically by the workflow in a business process.

Activities can be viewed and completed in many different locations.

## Activities
Activities can be viewed in a traditional list, board, or calendar view.

* **List View**. View your activities in a traditional view, see progress, choose displayed columns and sort the order of activities by the different columns.

* **Board View**. View your activities on boards. Create and configure multiple board views, setting custom lists and criteria that dynamically show activities matching the list criteria.

* **Calendar View**. View your activities in a calendar view, with options to view daily, weekly, or monthly.

## Activities Filters

* **Views**. Create custom views to manage which activities will be displayed on the List, Board, or Calendar views.

* **Status Filter**. Select from the available statuses.

## Activity Side Bar
Get quick access to all of your activities using the right-hand Activity side bar. Click the **My Activities** icon, which is a circled checkmark.
