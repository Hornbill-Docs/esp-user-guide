# Activity Board
You can create My Activity boards to visualize activities split into lists. Activities will dynamically appear or be removed from lists on boards based on the conditions defined against each list on a board.

## Create a new board
From the dropdown menu, click **Create New Board** and give the board a name and description, then click **Create**.

Title: Give the new list a title

Conditions: Use the clause builder to define the conditions for which activities will appear on the list
Test filer: Use this option to see how many activities match the conditions of the list filter before creating the list
