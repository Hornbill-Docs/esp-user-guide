## Activity categories

The sidebar categorizes activities to help you prioritize your work.

### New activities

The **New** section displays activities based on how they are assigned:

* **Directly to you**: Tasks assigned specifically to your user account.
* **To your groups**: Tasks assigned to a team or department you belong to. These appear under the specific group name.
* **To your roles**: Tasks assigned to a specific job role you hold. These appear under the specific role name.

### Filtered activities

Hornbill automatically sorts your current activities into the following time-based groups:

* **Overdue**: The due date passed.
* **Today**: The activity is due before the end of the current day.
* **Tomorrow**: The activity is due the following day.
* **Later**: The activity has a due date more than two days in the future.
* **Someday**: The activity does not have a set due date.

Each activity will enable the following options.

* **View or edit**: Select the activity title to open a window with full details. From here, you can modify the task or mark it as complete.
