# Email
The Email View gives you access to the Shared Mailboxes that you have been given access to. Shared Mailboxes are created to allow a group of users to share a single mailbox for both outgoing and incoming email, all using a common email address. Read, Send, and organize emails.


## Folders
Each Shared Mailbox contains 5 folders with an option to add additional folders to help organize your emails.

* **Inbox**. Contains incoming emails for the Shared Mailbox. Email Routing Rules can be configured to automatically move incoming emails to other designated folders.
* **Outbox**. Contains all emails that are currently waiting to be sent.
* **Sent Items**. Contains a copy of all emails sent from the Shared Mailbox
* **Deleted Items**. Contains a copy of all deleted emails


### Adding New Folders
To help organize your emails, additional folders can be created using the Create button. Each new folder is visible to all users that have access to the Shared Mailbox.

Select the Email Folder icon to create a new folder.
* Give the new folder a name and select Create Folder
* Default folders can't be deleted, but custom folders you have added can be deleted by using the Trash Can next to the folder you wish to delete

### Searching Emails in Folders
When in a folder use the Search option to open a search view and begin a search.

* Type your search term into the search box, and select the Magnifying Glass icon to begin the search
* The search will be performed on the to / from address, the subject and body of the email
* By default the search will be limited to the current folder, but use the Search in all folders button to expand the search to all folders.
* Search results will be relevance scored, and those with the best match will be represented with more stars

### Emptying Folders
Select the Empty Folder option at the bottom of the frame to delete and permanently delete the contents of the folder
