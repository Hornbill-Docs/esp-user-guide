# Notifications
Notifications are a way of getting updates within Hornbill that you are interested in. These include changes to workspaces that you have joined, posts and comments on the Buzz page of people you are following, conversations you are in, and tasks you have been assigned by a workflow in an automated business process. You can review your notifications by clicking the bell on the Control bar.

**A recommended way to review your notifications is to:**
1. Select News Feed and then review each workspace you are member of for any notifications.
1. Click the bell on the Control bar and review any remaining notifications from other co-workers, buzz, activities, or requests (if you are using Service Manager).

**To clear all notifications without reviewing them:**
1. At the bottom of the Notifications list, click **Dismiss All**.
