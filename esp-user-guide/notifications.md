# Notifications
Notifications are a way of getting updates within Hornbill that you are interested in. These include changes to workspaces that you have joined, posts and comments on the personal feed of people you are following, conversations you are in, and tasks you have been assigned by a workflow in an automated business process. 

## Notification bell
In the Profie tool bar, a Bell icon shows the count of your current un-read notifications and give you access to the Notification side bar.

## Notification Side bar
After clicking on the notification bell in the profile toolbar, a side panel is displayed that lists all of your current notification.

### Viewing notifications
Each notification includes the person that initiated the notification, a link to the related entity, and the main notification text.

### Dismissing notifications
Once the notification is clicked on and the source of the notification is viewed, the notification is removed from the list of notifications and the notification counter is adjusted.  

### Viewing dismissed notifications
After a notification has been cleared they can still be available to view by selecting the `Dismissed` checkbox.  

### Dismiss All
To clear all notifications without reviewing them, at the bottom of the Notifications list, click `Dismiss All`.  This will return the notification counter back to zero.  Dismissing notifications cannot be undone.
