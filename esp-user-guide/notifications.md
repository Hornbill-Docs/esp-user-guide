# Notifications
Notifications are a way of keeping touch with updates within Hornbill that you are interested in. These include changes to Workspaces that you have joined, posts and comments on the Buzz page of people yiou are following, Conversations you are in, or tasks you have been assigned by a workflow in an automated business process. You can review your notifications by selecting bell on the Control bar.

One good way to review your notifications is to:-

Select News feed and then review each workspace you are member of for any notifications
Selectbell on the Control bar and review any remaining notifications from other co-workers buzz, activities or requests (if you are using Service Manager)

You can clear all notifications without reviewing them using the 'Dismiss All' option at the top of the notifications list.
