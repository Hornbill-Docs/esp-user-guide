# Overview
In the Email view, you can find the shared mailboxes to which you have been given access. Shared mailboxes are created to allow a group of users to share a single mailbox for both outgoing and incoming email, all using a common email address. Here you can read, send, and organize emails.

## Folders
Each shared mailbox contains a set of folders by default, and you can [add additional folders](/esp-user-guide/email-overview#adding-new-folders) to help organize your emails.

* **Inbox.** Contains incoming emails for the shared mailbox. Email routing rules can be configured to automatically move incoming emails to other designated folders.
* **Outbox.** Contains all emails that are currently waiting to be sent.
* **Sent Items.** Contains a copy of all emails sent from the shared mailbox.
* **Deleted Items.** Contains a copy of all deleted emails.


### Adding new folders
To help organize your emails, you can add additional folders using the **Create** button. Each new folder is visible to all users who have access to the shared mailbox.
