# Contacts
Any individual who belongs to an external company who you wish to interact with during the delivery of a service will be stored in Hornbill as a contact record. Contact records would typically be associated with an company record. Contacts can be configured to use the Customer Portal for profile management and use of application features designed to allow for communication between you and your contacts.

To manage contact records, a user must possess one of the following security roles:

* Admin Role
* Contacts Admin

## Contact List
* As contacts are added, they will appear in the contacts list.
* You can configure the available display columns in the list to show the information that is important to you using the Cog Icon.
* Click on a specific contact record to view more information about that contact.
* Click on a contact's email address to launch the email composer to send an email from a shared mailbox you have access to.
* See which contacts have a portal account enabled.

### Searching Contacts
* **Quick Filter**. Use the filter to easily find a specific contact record, searching against their first name, surname, email address or the company they are associated too.
* **Advanced Filter**. Select the Funnel icon to expose additional search filters, including Job Title, Email, and Phone number.
* **Archived**. Use the File Box icon to filter the list of contacts to those which have been marked as archived.
* **Export**. Use the Download Arrow icon to export the filtered list of contacts
* **Global Search**. With the filter switched to Contact you can search for contacts from any view, and the results will be listed in the Contacts view.

### Adding Contacts

Contacts can be added using the + New Contact button.
* Complete the mandatory fields, and any optional fields including linking them to an existing company. Select Create to add the contact.
* Add a contact directly from a company record.
* Individual contacts can register themselves using Guest Access when logging in for the first time.

## Manage Contacts
From a contact's record, the following options are available to you.
* **Mark as Private**. Mark a contact as only being visible to you.
* **Archive**. If a contact is no longer needed or has left a company you deal with, mark them as Archived. This will remove them from general contact searches, but will still be accessible from the contact list and archived contacts option.
* **Audit History**. View all changes and amends which have been made to the contact's record.

## Customer Portal
Contacts can be configured to use the Customer Portal for profile management and use of application features designed for contacts. Portal Access is configured via Hornbill Administration: Home > System > Manage Portals > Guest Accounts.
* If a contact has been allocated a portal login, their portal login details will be visible on the contact record.
* If Service Manager has also been installed, you can configure what rights the contact has when viewing the company's requests on the customer portal, via the company record > Requests section > Portal Access option.

## Administration
* Users with the Form Designer role will be able to add custom fields, hide existing fields, edit their properties, and edit which sections of the contact record, fields are displayed in. This can achieved by dragging and dropping the fields into the required sections. With the Form Designer role, users will see a design option to go into edit mode.
* View and Manage contact portal access through Configuration > Platform Configuration > Customer Portal.
