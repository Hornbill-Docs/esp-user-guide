# Availability Status
The [User Availability Status](/esp-config/organizational-data/user-availability-states) is an optional feature that allows you to set your current work status. This can be a useful tool for your co-workers to determine if you are free for them to reach out to you.  Also, with Hornbill's powerful workflows, there are automatic actions that can consider your status to fulfill certain tasks.  

## Status Enabled
When enabled, you will see your current status in the [Profile toolbar](/esp-user-guide/navigation#profile-toolbar).

::: tip
This is a configurable list, so the items displayed might be different than shown above.
:::

Each status is color coded.  Different statuses may share the same color and will fall under the same category as described here.
* Green - I am available.
* Amber - I am at work and can be disturbed if important.
* Red - Do Not Disturb.
* Blue - I am on call.
* Grey - I am not at work.

### More
At the bottom of the list of statuses is a `More` option.  This allows you to expand on your status and provide some context.  For example, if you are Out of Office, you could say when you are expected back.

## Status Enabled with Time Recording
When Time Recording is enabled, the time of each status change will be captured and visible to you and other users.
