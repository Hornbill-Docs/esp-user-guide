# Availability Status
The [User Availability Status](/esp-config/organizational-data/user-availability-states) is an optional feature that allows you to set your current work status. This can be a useful tool for your co-workers to determine if you are free for them to reach out to you.  Also, with Hornbill's powerful workflows, there are automatic actions that can consider your status to fulfill certain tasks.  

## Status Enabled
When enabled, you will see your current status in the [Profile toolbar](/esp-user-guide/navigation#profile-toolbar).

Click on your current status to see a list of statuses that you can select from.

::: tip
Because your Hornbill administrator can configure this list, the items displayed might be different than shown above.
:::

Each status is color-coded.  Different statuses may share the same color and will fall under the same category as described here.
* Green - I am available.
* Amber - I am at work and can be disturbed if important.
* Red - Do not disturb.
* Blue - I am on call.
* Gray - I am not at work.

### More
At the bottom of the list of statuses is a `More` option.  This allows you to expand on your status and provide some context.  For example, if your status is set to *Out of Office*, you could enter a message to say when you are expected back.

## Time recording
When Time Recording is enabled, the time of each availability status change is captured and visible to you and other users.

## Login status
The loging status is displayed as a colored dot on a user's profile image and is based on their connection to Hornbill. This is automatically set each time they log in or out of Hornbill.

* Green is online.
* Amber is logged in but inactive.
* Red is offline.
* A mobile icon indicates they are online using the Hornbill mobile app.

The login status and the availability status compliment each other.  A user might set their availability to Out of office, but users could still see if they are online using the mobile app.

If a user is logged in using both a web browser and the Hornbill Mobile app, the green dot will be displayed.
