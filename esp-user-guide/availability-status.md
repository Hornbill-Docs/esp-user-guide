::: tip
This is a configurable list, so the items displayed might be different than shown above.

Each status is color coded.  Different statuses may share the same color and will fall under the same category as described here.
* Green - I am available.
* Amber - I am at work and can be disturbed if important.
* Red - Do Not Disturb.
* Blue - I am on call.
* Grey - I am not at work.

## Enabled with Time Recording
When Time Recording is enabled, the time of each status change will be captured and visible to you and other users.
