# Bookmarks
Bookmarks allow each user to save any Hornbill web page for quick access later. In addition, a full history of all the Hornbill web pages a user visit persists across browsers and sessions and provides contextual information about the bookmark and history pages.

## Bookmark categories
In order to bookmark content, you must first create bookmark categories against which to add the bookmarks.

Think about how you want to group your bookmarks. For example, you could have groups such as *Things to Review*, *Requests to review*, *Documents I need to look at*, or whatever makes sense to you.

**To create a bookmark category:**
1. Click the bookmark icon in the right-hand side collapsible panel.
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Add Bookmark Category**.
1. Give the bookmark category a name and click **OK**.

Remember these categories are personal to you; they will not be used by any other Hornbill user.

## Adding bookmarks
You can bookmark any Hornbill content, be it a post in a workspace, a document, or a request.

**To bookmark content:**
1. From the Bookmarks collapsible panel, make sure the required bookmark category is selected from the dropdown.
1. Click **Bookmark Current Page**. 
This adds the current page as a bookmark to that bookmark category.

Alternatively, from any post on an activity stream, use the **More Actions** dropdown, select **Add Bookmark** and then the bookmark category you wish to add the post to. This adds that page as a bookmark to the chosen bookmark category.

## Using and removing bookmarks
Once you have bookmarked content, you can easily access it from the Bookmarks collapsible panel.

### Open
To open a bookmark link, use the dropdown menu to navigate to the required bookmark category and click **Open**, or  click the bookmark icon next to the bookmark you wish to view.

### Search
Use the quick-search filter to find a specific bookmark based on its title or description.

### Edit
Hover over the bookmark you wish to edit and click the cog icon to:
* Edit the category under which the bookmark should be grouped.
* Edit the bookmark title.
* Edit the bookmark description.

### Remove
Hover over the bookmark and click **Delete** (the trash can icon).

## Bookmark history
By default, every Hornbill page you visit is marked, and you can view the history of all the pages you have visited from the History option in the dropdown menu.
