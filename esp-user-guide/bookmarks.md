# Bookmarks
Bookmarks allow a user to save a link to any Hornbill page, providing quick access later. In addition, a full history of all the Hornbill web pages a user has visited is available. The Bookmarks persist across browsers and sessions and provide contextual information about the bookmark and history pages.

## Bookmark categories
Before using bookmarks, you must have at least one category. Think about how you want to categorize your bookmarks. For example, *Posts to Revisit*, *Requests to Review*, *Documents I need to look at*.
