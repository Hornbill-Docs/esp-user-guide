# News Feed
The News Feed is a collation of all the posts and comments made in activity streams that you are following. The news feed can include updates from the different installed applications such as workspaces and personal feeds in [Collaboration](/collaboration-user-guide/about-collaboration), the timelines on incidents, problems, and changes in [Service Manager](/servicemanager-user-guide/index), updates and discussions on documents in [Document Manager](/documentmanager-user-guide/index), and more.

The News Feed provides real-time visibility of new posts and comments, giving you an instant view of the updates made to the things that are most important to you.

To access the News Feed, in the App toolbar, click the Home icon, then **News Feed**.

The News Feed and its content are also accessible via the Hornbill Mobile native apps for iOS and Android.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Can I add formatting to my text?** People often want to be able to add a bit of formatting to their comment or post. This might be making something bold or italic, or creating a bullet list. You can do this using [Hornbill markup](/esp-fundamentals/reference-guides/hornbill-wiki-markup).

**Can I edit my comment?** Yes, but be quick! There is an edit option under the **More Actions** option on the comment. However, once someone has liked your comment or another comment has been added after yours, you can no longer make an edit.
