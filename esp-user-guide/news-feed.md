# News Feed
The News Feed is a collation of all the posts and comments made in activity streams that you are following. These activity streams can include Workspaces, Users' Buzz, the timelines on incidents, problems, and changes in Service Manager, documents in Document Manager and Configuration Items in Configuration Manager.

The News Feed provides real time visibility of new posts and comments, making sure you have instant visibility of the updates made to the things that are most important to you.

The News Feed can be accessed from the main Application Menu located in the top left of the browser window, and then by selecting the News Feed menu item displayed under the Home icon.

The News Feed and it's content are also accessible via the Hornbill Mobile Native apps for iOS and Android.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Can I add formatting to my text?
People often want to be able to add a bit formatting to their comment. This might be making something bold or italic, or creating a bullet list. This is done using wiki markup. The available options can be seen here.

Can I edit my Comment?
Yes, but be quick! There is an edit option under the More Actions option on the comment. However, once someone has liked your comment or another comment has been added after yours, you can no longer make an edit.
