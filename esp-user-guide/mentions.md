# Mentions

When creating or updating activity streams (for a post or a comment), you can highlight one or more co-workers using a mention. Try mentioning by typing '@' and then their first name. As you type, a list of people appears. Select the person you want to mention, and see both their presence and availability status.

## Targeted communications

When you mention someone this way, the person will receive a Hornbill notification. They'll also be able to see the post in which they were mentioned, even if the post wasn't originally shared with them.

Mentioning people is particularly useful when you're on a post and you want to address someone specifically, or when you want to add someone to a post.
