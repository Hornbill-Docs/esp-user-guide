# Mentions

Introduction
When you are creating or updating activity streams (for a post or a comment), you can highlight one or more co-workers using a mention. Try mentioning them using the '@' signs and then their first name. As you type, a list of people appears. Select the person you want to mention, and see both their presence and availability status.

## Targeted communications

Doing this, the person will receive a Hornbill notification that you mentioned them in a post. They'll also be able to see the post in which they were mentioned, even if the post wasn't originally shared with them.

Mentioning people is particularly useful when you're on a post and you want to address someone specifically, or when you want to add someone to a post.
