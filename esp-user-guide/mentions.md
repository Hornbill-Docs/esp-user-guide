# Mentions

When creating or updating activity streams (for a post or a comment), you can highlight one or more co-workers using a mention. Try mentioning by typing '@' and then their first name. As you type, a list of people appears. Select the person you want to mention, and see both their presence and availability status.

## Targeted communications

When you mention someone this way, the person will receive a Hornbill notification. They'll also be able to see the post in which they were mentioned, even if the post wasn't originally shared with them.

Mentioning people is particularly useful when you're on a post and you want to address someone specifically, or when you want to add someone to a post.

## Mentions @ button
In the Profile toolbar, an **@** button shows the count of your current unread mentions and gives you access to the Mentions sidebar.

## Mentions sidebar
After clicking on the **@** button in the Profile toolbar, a side panel is displayed that lists all of your current mentions.

### Viewing mentions
Each mention includes the person that initiated the mention, a link to the related entity, and the main mention text.

### Dismissing mentions
Once the mention is clicked on and the source of the mention is viewed, the mention is removed from the list of mentions and the mention counter is adjusted.  

### Viewing dismissed mentions
After a mention has been cleared, it can still be available to view by selecting the **Dismissed** checkbox.  

### Dismiss All
To clear all mentions without reviewing them, at the bottom of the Mentions list, click **Dismiss All**.  This returns the mention counter back to zero.  Dismissing mentions cannot be undone.
