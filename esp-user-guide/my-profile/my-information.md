# My Information
The My Information section contains all the detailed information about you, personal and job related. Controls enable you to restrict who can view personal information about you.


The About section is broken down into five sections:

* **Basic Details**. Add an email address to allow other co-workers to send you an email from the Hornbill email composer when viewing your profile, and other views in Hornbill
* **Job Details**. View your memberships to organisational groups
* **Contact Details**.Add phone number and Social media details to allow other co-workers to contact you through browser plugins like Skype and Facetime
* **Interests & Expertise**. 
* **Personal Details**.

Edit the details held in each section by using the Notepad icon on each section header.

Not all available fields maybe displayed if they are empty, so going into edit mode may show more options. The option to not display empty fields is configurable by an administrator who has the Form Designer role.

## Privacy Settings
It is possible to manage who you share personal information with. When adding or updating your Contact Details, Interests & Expertise and Personal Details you can set a privacy level which you feel is appropriate for this information.
* **Public**. Everyone can see this.
* **Followers**. Co-workers that are following you can see this.
* **Private**. Only you can see this.

## Automatic Updates
When updating your contact information, remember this information maybe being updated automatically from a user import utility and from your organisations directory services, so check with your administrator if you are not sure. If automatic updates are set-up, this will overwrite any manually updated values on your About information if they are different on your organisations master directory records.

## System Configuration Updates
Administrators can update user's details from the Configuration Console.

* Add additional custom fields
