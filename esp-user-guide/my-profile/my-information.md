# My Information
You can edit your profile and manage privacy settings in the *My Information* view. To access *My Information*, click **Edit My Information** (the blue cog icon at the top right of your profile view).

The *My Information* view can contain various details about you -- personal and job-related. Controls enable you to restrict who can view what.

The **About** tab is broken down into five sections:

* **Basic Details**. Add an email address to allow co-workers to send you an email from the Hornbill email composer when viewing your profile, and from other views in Hornbill.
* **Job Details**. Your job title, job description, manager's name, organizational groups, and so on.
* **Contact Details**. Add a phone number and social media details to allow co-workers to contact you through browser plugins like Skype and FaceTime.
* **Interests & Expertise**. 
* **Personal Details**.

**To edit the details of your profile:**
1. Make sure you are in *My Information*. Click **Edit My Information** (the blue cog icon) at the top right of your profile view.
1. Click the Notepad icon on each section header.

::: tip
There are fields available that may not be displayed if they are empty. When you go into edit mode, you may see more options. (The option to *not* display empty fields is configurable by an administrator who has the Form Designer role.)

## Privacy settings
When adding or updating your Contact Details, Interests & Expertise, and Personal Details, you can manage who you share personal information with by setting the privacy level you feel is appropriate for this information.

**To adjust privacy settings:**
1. In the heading of each section, click the **Followers** button.
1. Select the setting you prefer, then click **Apply**.

Available settings are the following:
* **Public**. Everyone can see this.
* **Followers**. Co-workers that are following you can see this.
* **Private**. Only you can see this.

## Automatic updates
When updating your contact information, remember this information may be  updated automatically from a user import utility and from your organization's directory services. Check with your administrator if you are not sure. If automatic updates are set up, this will overwrite any manually updated values in your *About* information if they are different on your organization's master directory records.

## System configuration updates
Administrators can update user's details from the Configuration Console.

### Form Designer
Administrators with the Form Designer role will see a Design option which lets them do the following:
* Add additional custom fields.
* Mark fields as not visible.
* Mark fields as not being editable.
* Change field labels, make field values mandatory, choose whether fields should show if blank.
* Re-arrange the order fields appear in by dragging and dropping them into the desired order (including moving fields between *About* sections).

::: note
Design changes are global.
