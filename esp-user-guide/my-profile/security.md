### Registering A Mobile Device 
On your mobile device, download the Hornbill Mobile app from either the App Store for iOS devices or Google Play for Android devices. When you first open the Hornbill app, you will be guided through the following steps for setting up and linking your Mobile device securely to your Hornbill Account. Swipe left to access each step.

#### Step One
Using a web browser on a computer, log in to Hornbill and click on your profile image in the top corner to show the profile menu and select **My Settings**.

#### Step Two
Under the Security section, select the **Devices** option and click on the `Add New Device` button. Add a description for your device and click `Next`. A QR code will be displayed.  The QR code will be valid for 5 hours.

#### Step Three
Return to your mobile device, and on the final page of instructions, the mobile device's camera will be enabled. Point the Camera at the QR code on the web browser.

This will complete the registration of the Mobile device, activate it, and log you into the Hornbill app with your user account. Repeat this process for any additional mobile devices you want to add to your user account.
