## The About information is broken down into five sections:

Contact Details

Personal Details
Edit the details held in each section by using the Notepad icon on each section header.

Not all available fields maybe displayed if they are empty, so going into edit mode may show more options. The option to not display empty fields is configurable by an administrator who has the Form Designer role.
