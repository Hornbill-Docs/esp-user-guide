# My Profile
Your profile is your identity in Hornbill. The information provided on your profile can help others know more about you.

## How to access
To access your profile, in the [Profile toolbar](/esp-user-guide/navigation#profile-toolbar), click your profile image and then click **My Profile**.

Another way to access your profile is by clicking the **Configuration** cog in the bottom left of your screen.

## Your *About* information
This information is broken down into the following sections:

* **Basic Details.** Add an email address to allow co-workers to send you an email from the Hornbill email composer when viewing your profile, and from other views in Hornbill.
* **Job Details** Your memberships to organizational groups.
* **Contact Details.** Add phone numbers and social media details to allow  co-workers to contact you through browser plugins like Skype and FaceTime.
* **Interests & Expertise.** Add qualifications, training, interests, and expertise.
* **Personal Details.**

To edit the details held in each section, click the Notepad icon on each section header.

If some fields are empty, they may not be displayed. For this reason, going into edit mode may show you more options. The option to not display empty fields is configurable by an administrator who has the Form Designer role.
