# Email Composer
Create, reply to, or forward email messages. Use the email editor in combination with email templates and snippets to format the content for the outgoing email.

* **To**. Use the search Add recipient field to add one or more recipents.  As you type, existing co-workers and contacts that match the typed text will display for easy selection.
* **Cc & Bcc**. Use these buttons to display additional fields for carbon copying (Cc) or blind carbon copying (Bcc) other contacts and co-workers.
* **Attach Files**. Use this option to drag and drop attachments or explore to add them to the email.
* **Template**. Use this option to select a predefined template
* **Priority**. Use the exclamation mark to set the email's priority as High, Medium, or Low.
* **Subject**. Specify the text that will appear in the subject line of the outgoing email.
* **Body**. Use the toolbar options to format the content of the email, add images and links, and preview how the email will appear before sending it.

Use the `Send` option to send the email, or select `Discard` to exit the composer without sending the email.

## Templates
Templates provide a way to create commonly used email content that can be reused. Templates can be personal or shared with members of one of your groups to ensure consistent messaging.

### Using Snippets
Choose an email snippet from the list of available snippets. This will automatically insert the snippet's content into the email composer at the location of the current insertion point, integrating it with any existing content.

## Plug-ins
### Timesheet Manager
If you have the Timesheet Manager configured, you will see a clock that automatically records the time spent composing the email. Once the email is sent, the time will be recorded in the Timesheet Manager App.

Manually set the time spent by pausing the timer and entering the time. By default, a category for the time spent may be set. However, if you wish to change this, select a category and sub-category from the drop-down list.
