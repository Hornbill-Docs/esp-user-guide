# Email Composer
Create, reply to, or forward email messages. Use the email editor in combination with email templates and snippets to format the content for the outgoing email.

## Email content
When sending an email from the mailbox view there are a number of options available to you:

* **From**. If you only have access to one shared mailbox, the "From" address will be fixed. However, if you have access to more than one, you can choose which mailbox to send the email from.
* **To**. Use the search field to add one or more co-workers and contacts.
* **Cc & Bcc**. Use these buttons to display additional fields for carbon copying (Cc) or blind carbon copying (Bcc) other contacts and co-workers.
* **Attach**. Use this option to drag and drop attachments or explore to add them to the email.
* **Priority**. Use the exclamation mark to set the email's priority as High, Medium, or Low.
* **Subject**. Specify the text that will appear in the subject line of the outgoing email.
* **Body**. Use the toolbar options to format the content of the email, add images and links, and preview how the email will appear before sending it.

Use the "Send" option to send the email, or select "Discard" to exit the composer without sending the email.

## Templates
It can be beneficial to predefine email template content that you regularly use or wish to share with members of your groups to ensure consistent messaging. To facilitate this, you can create and utilize both personal email templates and those that can be shared with groups you are a part of, allowing other members to access them.

### Managing templates
Click on the `Template` option, then select `Manage Templates`.

#### Add a new template
1. Give the template a name that will easily identfy the template when being selected from a list.
1. From the `Add To` option select `Personal Templates` if the template will only be available to you. To share the template, select `Groups` and choose one of your groups that the template will be available to.
1. Add the subject text.
1. Use the email editor to construct the body of the email.
1. Use the `Insert Params` option to add the variables of the user who the email will be sent from. If a template is shared with a group, and a member of the group uses the template, then the first name, surname, job title etc variables will resolve to their details.
1. Click `Create` to make the template available.

## Snippets
Like Templates, Snippets allow you to pre-define content to inject into the email composer

### Creating an Email Snippet
Click on the Snippets option and choose Manage Snippets, and Add New.

1. Give the Snippet a name.
1. From the `Add To` option choose if the Snippet will only be available to you by choosing `Personal Snippets`. To share the snippet, select `Groups` and choose one of your groups which the snippet will be available to.
1. Use the editor to add the content for the Snippet.
1. Use the `Insert Params` option to add the variables of the user who the email will be sent from. If a Snippet is shared with a group, and a member of the group uses the Snippet, then the first name, surname, job title etc variables will resolve to their details.
1. Click `Create` to make the Snippet available

### Using Snippets
Choose an email snippet from the list of available snippets. This will automatically insert the snippet's content into the email composer at the location of the current insertion point, integrating it with any existing content.

### Manage Snippets
Click on "Snippet" and then "Manage Snippets" to view a list of the snippets you have created. You can open an existing snippet to edit, save changes, or delete it if it is no longer needed.

## Plug-ins
### Timesheet Manager
If you have the Timesheet Manager configured, you will see a clock that automatically records the time spent composing the email. Once the email is sent, the time will be recorded in the Timesheet Manager App.

Manually set the time spent by pausing the timer and entering the time. By default, a category for the time spent may be set. However, if you wish to change this, select a category and sub-category from the drop-down list.
